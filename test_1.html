<h3>MPC Gauge</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Points file creation</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measurement results should be converted into points file, which is the input format of bfit. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gauge was created using bfit-gauge, then the points file is created along with the gauge pattern.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measurement results should then be filled into the cd column in [um] unit.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gauge was created in some other manner, then a manually prepared points file is required;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one that has the correct preamble and having at least these columns: x, y, design, direction, category, cd.<br>
